# Wildlife Animal Intrusion Detection System

## Description
The **Wildlife Animal Intrusion Detection System** is designed to monitor and detect animal movements in wildlife sanctuaries and forest areas using camera traps. The system captures images of wildlife and analyzes them using the YOLOv8 model to classify animals. If a dangerous animal is detected, an email alert is sent to the appropriate authorities, enabling them to take necessary action promptly.

This project leverages data from the Karnataka Forest Department to enhance conservation efforts and prevent human-animal conflicts.

## Features
- **Camera Trap Monitoring**: Captures images using PIR sensor-triggered camera traps.
- **YOLOv8 Image Classification**: Classifies wildlife based on the detected image to identify dangerous species.
- **Real-Time Email Alerts**: Sends email notifications to authorities if a dangerous animal is detected.
- **Cloud Integration**: Stores images and analysis data in the cloud for monitoring and further evaluation.
